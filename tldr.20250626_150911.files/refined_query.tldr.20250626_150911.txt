To better understand your question about C. diff, it might be helpful to explore a few related areas:

1. **Nutritional Sources**: What specific nutrients or substrates does C. difficile utilize for growth during an infection, and how do these differ from its behavior in a healthy gut environment?

2. **Gut Environment**: How does the presence of antibiotics or changes in gut flora affect the availability of resources for C. diff, and what implications does this have for its virulence?

3. **Metabolism**: What metabolic pathways does C. diff employ when it is causing an infection, and how do these pathways contribute to its pathogenicity?

4. **Impact of Diet**: How does the diet of an individual influence the growth and activity of C. difficile in the gut, particularly during an infection?

5. **Preventative Measures**: What steps can be taken to limit the growth of C. diff in terms of diet or gut health management prior to infection?

These areas could provide a more comprehensive understanding of what C. difficile "eats" and how it affects the body during an infection.
