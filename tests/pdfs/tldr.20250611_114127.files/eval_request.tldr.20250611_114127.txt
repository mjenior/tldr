Due to growingantibiotic resistance and recurrent infection, targeting C. dif ﬁcilemetabolism presents\na new approach to combat this infection. Genome-scale metabolic network recon-\nstructions (GENREs) have been used to identify therapeutic targets and uncover prop-\nerties that determine cellular behaviors. Thus, we constructed C. dif ﬁcileGENREs for a\nhypervirulent isolate (strain [str.] R20291) and a historic strain (str. 630), validatingboth with in vitro and in vivo data sets. Growth simulations revealed signi ﬁcant corre-\nlations with measured carbon source usage (positive predictive value [PPV] $92.7%),\nand single-gene deletion analysis showed .89.0% accuracy. Next, we utilized each\nGENRE to identify metabolic drivers of both sporulation and bio ﬁlm formation.\nThrough contextualization of each model using transcriptomes generated from in vitro\nand infection conditions, we discovered reliance on the pentose phosphate pathway\nas well as increased usage of cytidine and N-acetylneuraminate when virulence expres-\nsion is reduced, which was subsequently supported experimentally. Our results high-light the ability of GENREs to identify novel metabolite signals in higher-order pheno-types like bacterial pathogenesis.\nIMPORTANCE Clostridioides dif ﬁcilehas become the leading single cause of hospital-\nacquired infections. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of speci ﬁc\nmetabolic pathways in aspects of C. dif ﬁcilepathophysiology, from initial colonization\nto regulation of virulence factors. In the past, genome-scale metabolic network\nreconstruction (GENRE) analysis of bacteria has enabled systematic investigation ofthe genetic and metabolic properties that contribute to downstream virulence phe-notypes. With this in mind, we generated and extensively curated C. dif ﬁcileGENREs\nfor both a well-studied laboratory strain (str. 630) and a more recently characterized\nhypervirulent isolate (str. R20291). In silico validation of both GENREs revealed high\ndegrees of agreement with experimental gene essentiality and carbon source utiliza-tion data sets. Subsequent exploration of context-speci ﬁc metabolism during both in\nvitro growth and infection revealed consistent patterns of metabolism which corre-\nsponded with experimentally measured increases in virulence factor expression. Our\nresults support that differential C. dif ﬁcilevirulence is associated with distinct meta-\nbolic programs related to use of carbon sources and provide a platform for identi ﬁ-\ncation of novel therapeutic targets.\nKEYWORDS Clostridioides dif ﬁcile, metabolic modeling, transcriptomics, virulence\nfactorsCitation Jenior ML, Leslie JL, Powers DA,\nGarrett EM, Walker KA, Dickenson ME, Petri WA,Jr, Tamayo R, Papin JA. 2021.

Susceptibility to\nC. dif ﬁcileinfection (CDI) is most frequently preceded by exposure to antibiotic therapy\n(3). While these drugs are lifesaving, they also diminish the abundance of other bacte-\nria in the microbiota, altering the metabolic environment of the gut and leaving it\nsusceptible to colonization by C. dif ﬁcile(4–6). Recently, we observed that C. dif ﬁcile\nadapts transcription of distinct catabolic pathways to the unique conditions in suscep-\ntible gut environments following different antibiotic pretreatments (7, 8). These tran-\nscriptional shifts indicated that C. dif ﬁcilemust coordinate metabolic activity accord-\ningly to compete within new hosts. In spite of these differences, there are known core\nelements of C. dif ﬁcilemetabolism across different environments including carbohy-\ndrate and amino acid fermentation (9). It is known that speci ﬁc growth nutrients in ﬂu-\nence expression of virulence genes in C. dif ﬁcile(9, 10). Given these ﬁndings, targeted\ntherapeutic strategies that alter active metabolism and downregulate virulence may\nbe possible without continued exposure to antibiotics. This form of treatment would\nbe especially bene ﬁcial as there have been stark increases in the prevalence of antibi-\notic resistance and hypervirulence among C. dif ﬁcileclinical isolates (11, 12).\nGenome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are mathematical for-\nmalizations of metabolic reactions encoded in the genome of an organism. These\nmodels are subsequently constrained by known biological and physical parameterssuch as membrane transport and enzyme kinetics. GENREs can be utilized to interro-\ngate the metabolic capability of a given organism, as well as providing a means to sim-\nulate growth and assess the impact of genotype on metabolism. GENREs have been\nimplemented in directing genetic engineering efforts (13) and accurately predicting\nauxotrophies and interactions between species for growth substrates (14, 15). These\nplatforms also create improved context for the interpretation of omics data (16), and\nhave provided powerful utility for identi ﬁcation of novel drug and gene targets, accel-\nerating downstream laboratory testing (17). This concept is especially critical when\ndelineating a complex array of signals from communities of organisms like the gutmicrobiome (18). Leveraging these tools, several recent studies have identi ﬁed nodes\nof metabolism that promise to provide novel therapeutic targets in clinically relevant\npathogens including Klebsiella pneumoniae ,Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus\nmutans (17, 19, 20). However, there has been limited progress to date applying GENREs\nto obtain mechanistic understanding for metabolism during infection as they relate to\ncolonization and virulence. Taken together, these principles make GENREs strong plat-\nforms for deciphering novel metabolic drivers of virulence-associated phenotypes in C.\ndifﬁcile.\nWe began by generating new GENREs for two strains of C. dif ﬁcileincluding a highly\ncharacterized laboratory strain, C. dif ﬁcilestrain (str.) 630 (21), as well as a more recently\nisolated hypervirulent strain, R20291 (22). De novo reconstruction for both models was\nfollowed by extensive literature-driven manual curation of catabolic pathways and\nrelated metabolite transport, with speci ﬁc emphasis on Stickland fermentation for ATP\ngeneration and C. dif ﬁcile-speci ﬁc redox maintenance (23). Additionally, both GENREs\ncontain a tailored biomass objective function (an in silico proxy for bacterial growth,\nrequiring synthesis of major macromolecular components) which accounts for codon\nbiases and amino acid balance and cell wall structure. Growth simulations from both\nGENREs were compared against in vitro gene essentiality and carbon utilization\nscreens, which indicated signi ﬁcant levels of agreement across all validation data sets.\nTo assess potential mechanisms of metabolic control of virulence, we then created\ncontext-speci ﬁc models of C. dif ﬁcilemetabolism by integrating transcriptomic data\ncollected from both laboratory culture and infection conditions where differential\nexpression of C. dif ﬁcilevirulence factors was observed. Overall, during increased viru-\nlence expression both strains of C. dif ﬁcilewere predicted to favor increased fermenta-\ntion of amino acids and decreased reliance on carbohydrate usage. Speci ﬁcally in the\nhypervirulent strain R20291 during states of phase variation, we found ef ﬂux of theJenior et al.\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 2\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\nbioﬁlm component N-acetylglucosamine in variants known to produce signi ﬁcantly\nmore bio ﬁlm experimentally. Additionally, this state was predicted to have increased\nreliance on glucose to fuel nucleotide synthesis, instead of ATP generation. Whentested in vitro , we indeed found that the colony morphology associated with this\nphase variant was dependent on environmental glucose availability. Alternatively, ininfection-speci ﬁc models of strain 630, we identi ﬁed consistent patterns of proline and\nornithine fermentation in states of both high and low sporulation, which agreed withmetabolomic analysis of each condition. However, in instances of lower spore burden\nour model predicted signi ﬁcantly greater usage of the host-derived glycan N-acetyl-\nneuraminate (Neu5Ac) and the nucleotide precursor cytidine as primary sources of car-bon. In subsequent laboratory testing we were able to show that not only can C. dif ﬁ-\ncileuse the substrates for growth but also both lead to lower quantities of spores,\nwhich are essential for transmission of the pathogen (24, 25). This work is the ﬁrst time\nthat contextualized GENREs of a pathogen have been utilized to identify new metabo-lite signals of virulence regulation. As such, the high-quality GENREs described herecan greatly augment the discovery of novel metabolism-directed therapeutics to treatCDI. Moreover, our results demonstrate that GENREs provide an advantage for delin-eating complex patterns in transcriptomic and metabolomic data sets into tractable ex-perimental targets.\nRESULTS\nC. dif ﬁcilemetabolic network generation, gap- ﬁlling, and curation. The emer-\ngence of hypervirulent strains of C. dif ﬁcilethat have unique metabolism and virulence\nfactors highlights the importance for the in-depth study of metabolic pathways tounderstand and identify targets within these isolates. Core metabolic processes alsopresent an attractive target for novel antimicrobial measures as they may be less likely\nto allow for acquired antibiotic resistance (26). With these concepts in mind, we\nfocused on the best-characterized hypervirulent isolate, str. R20291. However, to maxi-mize the utility of the bulk of published C. dif ﬁcilemetabolic research, we elected to\ngenerate a reconstruction for the lab-adapted str. 630 in parallel. This focus affordedthe ability to continuously cross-reference curations between the models and to morereadily identify emergent differences that are speci ﬁcally due to genomic content.\nWe began the reconstruction process by accessing the reannotated genome of str.\n630 (27) and the published str. R20291 genome (22), both available on the Pathosystems\nResource Integration Center database (PATRIC) (28). Following an established protocolfor creating high-quality genome-scale models (29), and utilizing the ModelSEED frame-work and modi ﬁed reaction database (30), we created scaffold reconstructions for both\nstrains. We subsequently performed complete translated proteome alignment betweenstr. 630 and str. R20291, resulting in 684 homologous metabolic gene products and 22and 33 unique gene products, respectively (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).Among the distinctive features were additional genes for dipeptide import in str. 630and glycogen import and utilization in str. R20291, which have both been linked tomodulated levels of virulence across strains of C. dif ﬁcile(31, 32).\nManual curation is required to ultimately produce high-quality GENREs and make\nmeaningful biological predictions (33). As such, we proceeded to manually incorporate259 new reactions (with associated genes and metabolites) and altered the conditionsof an additional 312 reactions already present within each GENRE prior to gap- ﬁlling\n(Table S1). Primary targets and considerations for the manual curation of the C. dif ﬁcile\nGENREs included the following:\n/C15Anaerobic glycolysis, fragmented tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and known\nmolecular oxygen detoxi ﬁcation (23, 34)\n/C15Minimal medium components and known auxotrophies (35 –37)\n/C15Aminoglycan and dipeptide catabolism (38 –40)\n/C15Numerous Stickland fermentation oxidative and reductive pathways (Table S2)\n(41–52)Metabolic Determinants of C. dif ﬁcileVirulence\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 3\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\n/C15Carbohydrate fermentation and short-chain fatty acid metabolism (41, 53 –55)\n/C15Elements of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (56)\n/C15Energy metabolite reversibility (e.g., ATP, GTP, FAD, etc.) (57)\n/C15Structural components including teichoic acid, peptidoglycan, and isoprenoid\nbiosynthesis\n/C15Additional pathogenicity-associated metabolites (e.g., p-cresol [44] and ethanolamine\n[58])\nFollowing the outlined manual additions, we created a customized biomass objective\nfunction with certain elements tailored to each strain of C. dif ﬁcileand complete synthe-\nsis requirements for macromolecular components. Our biomass objective function for-mulation was initially adapted from the well-curated GENRE of the close phylogeneticrelative Clostridium acetobutylicum (59) with additional considerations for tRNA synthesis\nand formation of cell wall macromolecules, including teichoic acid and peptidoglycan\n(Table S1). Coef ﬁcients within the formulations of DNA replication, RNA replication, and\nprotein synthesis component reactions were adjusted by genomic nucleotide abundan-ces and codon frequencies to yield strain-speci ﬁc biomass objective functions (60). To\nsuccessfully simulate growth, we next performed an ensemble-based parsimonious ﬂux\nbalance analysis (pFBA) gap- ﬁlling approach (61, 62), utilizing a metabolic reaction data-\nbase centered on Gram-positive anaerobic bacterial metabolism (see Materials andMethods). Gap- ﬁlling refers to the automated process of identifying incomplete meta-\nbolic pathways due to an absence of genetic evidence that are necessary for in silico\ngrowth and addition of the minimal functionality needed to achieve ﬂux through these\npathways (63). We performed gap- ﬁlling across six distinct and progressively more lim-\nited medium conditions —complete medium, brain heart infusion (BHI) (64), C. dif ﬁcile\ndeﬁned medium with and without glucose (CDM) (37), no-carbohydrate minimal me-\ndium (NCMM) (5), and basal de ﬁned medium (BDM) (35) —which added a total of 68\nnew reactions that allowed for robust growth across all conditions, the largest fraction ofwhich was involved in large phospholipid biosynthesis for generation of more complexcell wall components (Table S1).\nTheﬁnal steps of the curation process were focused on limiting the directionality of\nreactions known to be irreversible, extensive balancing of the remaining incorrect reac-tion stoichiometries, and adding annotation data for all network components. Thisstep also included adding gene associations to gap- ﬁlled reactions where possible.\nAfter completion, we repeated the assessments that were performed for the earlierreconstructions and found that our GENREs had substantial improvements in all met-\nrics including few, if any, ﬂux or mass inconsistencies, and now each received a cumu-\nlative MEMOTE score of 86% (Table S1). The new network reconstructions were desig-nated iCdG709 (str. 630) and iCdR703 (str. R20291).\nC. dif ﬁcileGENRE validation against laboratory measurements.

Recently, a large-scale transposon mutagenesis screen was pub-lished for str. R20291 (67), and as such, we utilized the proteomic alignment from the previ-ous section to determine homologs in str. 630. While interpretation of results from in vitro\nessentiality screens of this nature can be dif ﬁcult and associated with a degree of noise,\nthey provide an important starting point for initial model validation as well as a basis forfuture curation efforts. Simulating growth in BHI rich medium, we identi ﬁed essential genes\nfor both models, which revealed overall accuracies of 89.1% and 88.9%, with negative pre-\ndictive values as high as 90.0% for iCdR703 and 89.9% for iCdG709 (Fig. S1A). This high\ndegree of agreement supported that metabolic pathways in the new GENREs were struc-tured correctly and are more likely to provide useful downstream predictions.\nTo then assess if GENRE requirements re ﬂected the components of minimal medium\nderived experimentally, we identi ﬁed the minimum subset of metabolites necessary forJenior et al.\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 4\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\ngrowth. Through systematic limitation of extracellular metabolites, we were able to deter-\nmine the impact of each component on achieving some level of biomass ﬂux (Fig. S1C). This\nanalysis revealed that most metabolites found to be essential during growth simulationhave also been shown experimentally to be required for in vitro growth in basal de ﬁned me-\ndium (BDM) (35). Interestingly, while growth simulations indicated that neither iCdG709 (str.\n630) nor iCdR703 (str. R20291) was auxotrophic for methionine, the published formulationof BDM indicates methionine is found to be largely growth enhancing but not essential for\nlow levels of growth (36). Additionally, it has been demonstrated in the laboratory that C. dif-\nﬁcileis able to harvest suf ﬁcient bioavailable sulfur from excess cysteine instead of methio-\nnine (37, 68), further supporting growth simulation results. Similarly, the published formula-\ntion of BDM indicates that pantothenate (vitamin B\n5) appears to enhance growth rate only\nin vitro and is not necessarily required to support low growth rates. Our results also indicated\nthat iCdR703 was not auxotrophic for isoleucine relative to iCdG709 and indeed contained\nadditional genes coding for synthesis of a precursor (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate ( ilvC,a\nketol-acid reductoisomerase) which were not present in its counterpart GENRE (Table S2). In\nsummary, the in silico minimal requirements for iCdG709 and iCdR703 closely mirrored ex-\nperimental results for both strains of C. dif ﬁcilein the laboratory.\nWe next assessed additional carbon sources that impact the growth yield predictions\nfor both GENREs. Utilizing previously published results for both C. dif ﬁcilestrains in a\nhigh-throughput screen (69), we simulated growth for each carbon source individually in\nbackground minimal medium and calculated the shift in optimal growth rate.Importantly, C. dif ﬁcileis auxotrophic for speci ﬁc amino acids (e.g., proline [Fig. S1C]) that\nit is also able to catabolize through Stickland fermentation (70), so the background me-\ndium must be supplemented with low concentrations of each. As such, the values arereported as the ratio of the ﬁnal optical density for growth with the given metabolite to\nlow levels of growth observed in the background medium alone. Through correlation of\nthe results from these two comparisons, we were able to assess how well in silico predic-\ntions matched experimental results. Across all the 116 total metabolites that were in\nboth the in vitro screen and the C. dif ﬁcileGENREs, we identi ﬁed signi ﬁcant predictive\ncorrelations in the amount of growth enhancement for iCdG709 and iCdR703 ( P\nvalues,0.001) (Fig. 1A and B). This relationship was even more pronounced for carbo-\nhydrates and amino acids, the primary carbon sources for C. dif ﬁcile. When these predic-\ntions were reduced to binary interpretations of either enhancement or nonenhancement\nof growth, we found that iCdG709 predicted 92.8% and iCdR703 predicted 96.6% true-\npositive enhancement calls (Fig. S1B). This metric is most valuable here as it indicates\nthat each GENRE possesses the necessary machinery for catabolizing a given metabolite.\nFIG 1 Carbon source utilization prediction pro ﬁles accurately re ﬂect laboratory measurements.\nResults from previous phenotypic screen of 115 metabolites for both str. 630 and str. R20291 werecompared against in silico results for each corresponding GENRE. Ratios of overall in vitro growth\nenhancement by each metabolite were correlated with the corresponding results from growth\nsimulations in the same media for iCdG709 (str. 630) (A) and iCdR703 (str. R20291) (B). Points arecolored by their biochemical grouping, ﬁt, and signi ﬁcance determined by Spearman correlation.Metabolic Determinants of C. dif ﬁcileVirulence\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 5\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\nCollectively, these data strongly indicated that both GENREs were well suited for predic-\ntion of growth substrate utilization in either strain of C. dif ﬁcile.\nFinally, we also compared our results against existing C. dif ﬁcileGENREs. The pri-\nmary focus of curated C. dif ﬁcilemetabolic modeling efforts has been on the ﬁrst fully\nsequenced strain of C. dif ﬁcile, str. 630. The ﬁrst reconstruction effort (iMLTC806cdf\n[71]) and subsequent revision (icdf834 [71, 72]) were followed by a recent de novo crea-\ntion following updated genome curation (iCN900 [27, 73). Another GENRE was devel-\noped for str. 630 Derm (iHD992 [74]), a strain derived from str. 630 by serial passage\nuntil erythromycin resistance was lost (75). Four additional C. dif ﬁcilestrain GENREs\nwere generated as a part of an effort to generate numerous new reconstructions for\nmembers of the gut microbiota (76); these reconstructions received only semiauto-mated curation performed without C. dif ﬁcile-speci ﬁc considerations. To establish a\nbaseline for the metabolic predictions possible with current C. dif ﬁcileGENREs, we\nselected common criteria with large impacts on the quality of subsequent predictionsfor model performance (Table S3). The ﬁrst of these metrics is the level of consistency\nin the stoichiometric matrix (57, 77, 78), which re ﬂects proper conservation of mass\nand that no metabolites are incorrectly created or destroyed during simulations. The\nnext metric is a ratio for the quantity of metabolic reactions lacking gene-reaction rulesto those possessing associated genes (79), which may indicate an overall con ﬁdence in\nthe annotation of the reactions. These features re ﬂect the importance of mass conser-\nvation and deliberate gene/reaction annotation which each drive con ﬁdence in down-\nstream metabolic predictions, omics data integration, and likelihood for successful\ndownstream experimentation. We found unique challenges within each GENRE which\nmade comparing simulation results across models dif ﬁcult. Neither iMLTC806cdf nor\niHD994 has any detectable gene annotations associated with the reactions it contains.A high degree of stoichiometric matrix inconsistency was detected across icdf834,\niHD992, and iCN900; with iHD992 many intracellular metabolites were able to be gen-\nerated without acquiring necessary precursors from the environment. We alsodetected structural inconsistencies across several GENREs. For example, those GENREs\nacquired from the AGORA database possessed several intracellular metabolic products\nnot adequately accounted for biologically (Table S3), as well as mitochondrial compart-ments despite being bacteria. Additionally, several key C. dif ﬁcilemetabolic pathways\nwere either incomplete or absent from the curated models including multistep\nStickland fermentation, membrane-dependent ATP synthase, dipeptide and aminogly-can utilization, and a variety of saccharide fermentation pathways (23). Consideringeach of these factors, the C. dif ﬁcileGENREs generated here correct numerous mass\nand annotation inconsistencies, contain key functional capacities, and phenotypically\nmimic C. dif ﬁcile.\nContext-speci ﬁc modeling to capture virulence-associated metabolism. Following\nvalidation, we sought to utilize each GENRE to predict in situ metabolic phenotypes\nthat correspond with expression of known virulence traits in C. dif\nﬁcile. As previously\nstated, GENREs have provided powerful platforms for the integration of transcriptomic\ndata, creating greater context for the shifts observed between conditions and captur-ing the potential in ﬂuence of pathways not obviously connected (80). With this appli-\ncation in mind, we chose to generate context-speci ﬁc models for both in vitro and in\nvivo experimental conditions characterized with transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq)\nanalysis utilizing a recently published unsupervised transcriptomic data integrationmethod (18). Brie ﬂy, the algorithm calculates the most cost-ef ﬁcient usage of the meta-\nbolic network to achieve growth given the pathway investments indicated by the tran-\nscriptomic data. This approach is in line with the concept that natural selection gener-ally selects against wasteful production of cellular machinery (81). The output models\ncontain only those metabolic reactions that are most likely to be active under the\ngiven conditions, whose ranges of metabolic reaction activity were subsequentlydeeply sampled to assess for distinct yet equally optimal combinations of active path-ways. Analysis of these distributions affords the ability to make much more ﬁne-scaleJenior et al.\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 6\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\npredictions of metabolic changes that C. dif ﬁcileundergoes as it activates pathogenic-\nity. The patterns of active pathways also reveal critical elements within context-speci ﬁc\nmetabolism that could lead to targeted strategies for intentional downregulation of\nvirulence factors through metabolite-focused interventions.\nPhase variation in C. dif ﬁcilestr. R20291 is sensitive to carbohydrate availability.\nC. dif ﬁcileis known to utilize phase variation, a reversible mechanism employed by\nmany bacterial pathogens to generate phenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity to\nmaximize overall ﬁtness of the population. Phase variation has been shown to also\ninﬂuence virulence expression in C. dif ﬁcilestr. R20291 (82). One aspect of this phase\nvariation manifests as a rough- or smooth-edged colony morphology on solid agar; themorphologies can be propagated via subculture and are associated with distinct motil-\nity behaviors and altered virulence (83). The colony morphology variants are generated\nthrough the phase-variable (on/off) expression of the cmrRST genes. Toward under-\nstanding this phenotype, we experimentally generated rough and smooth phase var-iants of C. dif ﬁcilestr. R20291 grown on solid supplemented brain heart infusion (BHIS)\nrich medium for 48 h and sequenced transcriptomes from both groups. Utilizing these\ndata, we generated context-speci ﬁc versions of iCdR703 under simulated rich medium\nconditions and deeply sampled the resultant metabolic ﬂux distributions to assess all\npossible forms of metabolism given the new constraints.\nWhile it has been previously shown that mutation of cmr-family genes does not sig-\nniﬁcantly alter growth rate in vitro (83), the contextualized models predicted signi ﬁ-\ncantly increased biomass ﬂux generation (re ﬂective of growth rate) with smooth col-\nony-associated metabolism (Fig. S2A). This result ﬁts with experimental ﬁndings as the\nrough-edged phenotype emerges only after long periods of incubation on solid agar\nwhen growth rate is measurably lowered (43). We moved on to evaluate structural dif-\nferences between the context-speci ﬁc models and identi ﬁed those metabolic reactions\npredicted to be active in only the smooth or rough context-speci ﬁc model. With this\nanalysis we found 19 reactions that were distinctly active between conditions (Fig. 2A).\nWe then calculated median absolute activity for each reaction, which indicated the\nmagnitude at which each reaction contributed to optimal growth in each model. Thisinvestigation revealed that proline or ornithine fermentation was present and active ineither model (Fig. 2A). C. dif ﬁcileis capable of easily converting ornithine into proline\n(52), which is subsequently fermented to 5-aminovalerate for energy. This ﬁnding illus-\ntrated that proline Stickland fermentation was an integral part of C. dif ﬁcilemetabolism\nacross conditions. The ﬁnding that N-acetylglucosamine transport was present only\nwithin the smooth variant context-speci ﬁc model was striking as this phase has been\npreviously associated with signi ﬁcantly increased bio ﬁlm formation (83), in which N-\nacetyl- D-glucosamine is the primary component (84). Observing the predicted reaction\nactivity, not only was N-acetylglucosamine transport present exclusively in the smooth\nvariant context-speci ﬁc model, but this reaction was extremely active under these con-\nditions (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, ef ﬂux of the related metabolite D-glucosamine was also\nsigni ﬁcantly increased in the smooth model (Fig. 2D; Pvalue,0.001). These results\nsupported that the differences in context-speci ﬁc model structure seen between phase\nvariants likely represented real variation in active metabolism.\nTo then compare metabolic activity effectively between context-speci ﬁc models,\nwe next focused our analysis on shared nonbiomass associated reactions across con-\ntext-speci ﬁc models which we referred to as “core ”metabolism within each subse-\nquent analysis. We ﬁrst employed unsupervised machine learning for ﬂux samples\nfrom core reactions using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination ofBray-Curtis dissimilarities (Fig. S2B). This analysis revealed signi ﬁcantly different pat-\nterns of core metabolic activity between smooth and rough context-speci ﬁc models ( P\nvalue = 0.001). To further explore the speci ﬁc differences within active metabolism\nbetween phase variants, we utilized a supervised machine learning approach withRandom Forest to discriminate between rough and smooth core metabolic activity(Fig. 2B).

Further examination of alanine transport\nreaction ﬂuxes revealed that import and utilization of alanine were predicted only in\nthe smooth context (Fig. 2E). Alanine has been previously identi ﬁed as having a strong\nimpact on C. dif ﬁcilelife cycle physiology (85) and has also been shown to be essential\nfor proper bio ﬁlm formation in other Gram-positive pathogens (86). Our results indi-\ncate that utilization of alanine may also play a role in bio ﬁlm formation and phase vari-\nation in C. dif ﬁcile.\nBoth the network topology and metabolic activity-based analyses indicated that a\nlarge number of transporters and metabolic reactions were differentially active(Table S4), especially several relating to glycolysis. To more closely investigate the rela-\ntive importance of these metabolic pathways between phase variants, we performed\ngene essentiality analysis for both models and cross-referenced the results for meta-bolic reactions associated with the uptake and utilization of glucose (Fig. 3A). Throughthis comparison, we found numerous reactions that were essential only in the smoothcontext-speci ﬁc model which included multiple steps in the pentose phosphate pathway\nFIG 2 Metabolism signi ﬁcantly varies between phase variants of C. dif ﬁcilestr.

Strikingly, no reactions in either pathway were found to beuniquely essential in the rough context-speci ﬁc model. Although some components of gly-\ncolysis were essential in both contexts, including pyruvate kinase, the penultimate step with\nthe bulk of the ATP production was detected at the transcriptional level at nearly identicallevels between the rough and smooth isolates (Table S4). These ﬁndings together signi ﬁed\nthat ATP generation from glycolysis was important in both contexts, but the nucleotide pre-\ncursors and redox potential generated from the pentose phosphate pathway were neces-\nsary for the smooth variant-speci ﬁc metabolism. In line with this observation, the rough\ncontext-speci ﬁc model indeed generated a greater fraction of NADH from Stickland fer-\nmentation (Table S4). Based on these data, we hypothesized that this additional dependenceon glucose was critical in the smooth variants and without glucose colony morphology would\ntransition toward a more rough phenotype.\nFIG 3 Glucose utilization through the pentose phosphate pathway is essential in the smooth phase variants of str.

R20291, grown anaerobically for 48 h on BHIS agar (Fig. S3A). We\nfound that the hallmark metric of rough morphology is a signi ﬁcant increase in colony\nperimeter (Fig. 3D) and used this measurement for determining subsequent shiftsbetween the phenotypes. Both phase variants were subcultured onto BDM agar platesboth with and without 2 mg/ml glucose (Fig. 3B and C). Following anaerobic incubationfor 48 h, we found that rough variants maintained their morphology across both media,with the rough phenotype even exacerbated on the minimal medium. However, whilethe smooth variant largely maintained its colony morphology upon subculture ontoBDM1glucose, the colonies became signi ﬁcantly rough when glucose was absent\n(Fig. 3E). The inverse was also true in that the rough colonies maintained their morphol-ogy in the absence of glucose but signi ﬁcantly decreased in perimeter on BDM 1glu-\ncose, appearing more smooth (Fig. 3F). Further subculture of each altered morphologyfrom minimal medium back onto rich BHI medium also appeared to support consistentswitching between the respective morphologies (Fig. S3B). Our data supported that thesmooth phase variants relied on glucose for more than strictly ATP generation and thatthe rough morphology is apparent only after extended incubation when C. dif ﬁcilemay\nbe locally activating starvation responses and switching toward alternative energy sour-\nces. Additionally, when glucose is available, C. dif ﬁcilewill opt to generate redox poten-\ntial more ef ﬁciently through the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, these results\nare consistent with the hypothesis that carbohydrate availability impacts phase variationinC. dif ﬁcileand that environmental stress due to limited nutrients may be a key factor\nin driving the shift between phases.\nUtilization of N-acetylneuraminic acid and cytidine decreases sporulation in C.\ndifﬁcilestr. 630. While laboratory conditions are highly informative, it is even more\ncritical to examine metabolism for this pathogen during infection as it can more readilylead to novel therapeutic interventions. It has been previously shown that differentclasses of antibiotics have distinct impacts on the structure of the gut microbiota whileinducing similar sensitivity to colonization by C. dif ﬁcile(87). Along these lines, one\npublished study assessed differential transcriptional activity of C. dif ﬁcilestr. 630 in the\ngut during infection in a mouse model pretreated with the antibiotic cefoperazone orclindamycin. Crucially, these treatments resulted in highly dissimilar levels of sporula-tion (another phenotype linked to C. dif ﬁcilevirulence) where cefoperazone had largely\nundetectable spore CFU and clindamycin had signi ﬁcantly higher levels at the same\ntime point (7). These experiments included paired, untargeted metabolomic analysis ofintestinal content to correlate the transcriptional activity of metabolic pathways withchanges in the abundance of their respective substrates. Included in the analysis wereboth mock-infected and C. dif ﬁcile-colonized groups (both treated by the respective\nantibiotics) to extract the speci ﬁc impact of the infection on the gut environment, mak-\ning this data set extremely valuable.\nWeﬁrst compared predicted biomass objective ﬂux in the sampled context-speci ﬁc\nﬂux distributions (Fig. S4A), which revealed no signi ﬁcant difference between high-\nand low-sporulation conditions. However, ordination analysis, performed as describedabove, indeed revealed signi ﬁcant differences in predicted core metabolic activity\n(Fig. 4A; Pvalue = 0.001). Comparisons of overall context-speci ﬁc model ﬂux distribu-\ntions highlighted substantial differences in transporter and metabolic reaction networkcompositions and associated activities (Table S5). In agreement with these ﬁndings,\nsupervised machine learning analysis indicated numerous differences in reactions asso-ciated with metabolizing host-derived glycans and nucleotide precursors (Fig. S4B). Tofocus this assessment on growth substrates that may be differentially impacting theobserved levels of sporulation, we assessed each context-speci ﬁ\nc model by sequen-\ntially limiting the ability to import or export each extracellular metabolite to 1% of itsoptimal rate and measured the impact on overall biomass production (Fig. 4B and C).Paired metabolomic analyses of each metabolite identi ﬁed this way were then com-\npared within each condition for relative change in concentration following infection,represented as colored squares along the right margin of Fig. 4B and C. Many metabolitesJenior et al.\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 10\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\nhad no effect on biomass when their exchange rates were limited and simply rerouted\nmetabolism elsewhere to achieve similar levels of growth, which indicated a high degreeof metabolic plasticity remaining in each context-speci ﬁc model. All metabolites high-\nlighted by this analysis that were measured by the metabolomics screen followed themodel-predicted directional change in concentration, supporting the hypothesis that C.\ndifﬁcileitself is responsible for the observed differences (Fig. 4B and C). The peptides pro-\nline, ornithine, and serine were found to have an impact on the ability to grow acrossboth context-speci ﬁc models. Of this subset of amino acids, only proline is an auxotrophy\na n da l la r eu s a b l eb y C. dif ﬁcilein Stickland fermentation. Following the catabolism of pro-\nline, its Stickland fermentation by-product 5-aminovalerate was predicted to be an impor-\ntant ef ﬂux metabolite under both conditions and had concordant signi ﬁcant increases in\nconcentration following infection in each group (Fig. S4C). Alternatively, isovalerate ef ﬂux\nFIG 4 Predicted differences in C. dif ﬁcile str. 630 carbon source usage correspond with lowered rates of sporulation.

This short-chain\nfatty acid has been primarily associated with leucine fermentation in C. dif ﬁcile, supporting\nan elevated dependence on Stickland fermentation as sporulation increases. Intestinal\nconcentrations of leucine have indeed been shown to signi ﬁcantly decrease following\ninfection by C. dif ﬁcile in vivo (7), supporting its importance during infection. The most dis-\ntinguishing features were the importance of N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac) and cytidine\nonly in the lower-sporulation context-speci ﬁc model (Fig. 4C). N-Acetylneuraminate is a\nhost-derived component of sialic acid that C. dif ﬁciler e a d i l yu s e sa sac a r b o ns o u r c ef o r\ngrowth (7), and cytidine is an integral component of RNA synthesis. However, neither had\nbeen previously associated with directly in ﬂuencing virulence factor expression in C. dif ﬁ-\ncile.F u r t h e r m o r e ,w h i l e N-acetylneuraminate signi ﬁcantly decreases during infection in\nthe lower-sporulation context (7), cytidine also appears to decrease under these condi-\ntions, implying consumption by C. dif ﬁcile(Fig. S4D and E).\nWeﬁrst sought to measure if C. dif ﬁcilestr. 630 could utilize both N-acetylneurami-\nnate and cytidine as carbon sources and if together they exerted a combined effect on\ngrowth. Both N-acetylneuraminate and cytidine were supplemented (10 mg/ml each)\nin liquid BDM in parallel with liquid BDM with no additional substrate and BDM 1D-\nglucose (10 mg/ml) controls, into which C. dif ﬁcilestr. 630 was inoculated and incu-\nbated for 18 h and optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured every 5 min\n(Fig. 5A). This assay revealed that C. dif ﬁcilestr. 630 could indeed use N-acetylneurami-\nnate and cytidine as carbon sources independently, as each condition allowed for sig-niﬁcantly more growth than background BDM alone ( Pvalues,0.05). Additionally,\nthere was no discernible effect on growth when the two substrates were added simul-\ntaneously. Utilization of the nucleotide precursor cytidine as a carbon source during\ninfection has never been previously described in C. dif ﬁcile, which further supported\nthe utility of our models as a platform for augmenting discovery.\nTo then assess the effect of N-acetylneuraminate and cytidine on sporulation in C.\ndifﬁcilestr. 630, we performed a growth and sporulation assay targeting these sub-\nstrates using the same de ﬁned medium conditions described previously (Fig. 5B).\nFollowing 18 h of anaerobic growth, cultures were plated on BHIS agar plates lacking a\ngermination agent to quantify speci ﬁcally vegetative cell CFU abundance. Remaining\nliquid cultures were then treated with a ﬁnal concentration of 50% ethanol (EtOH) for\n60 min to eliminate vegetative cells and then plated on BHIS agar with 1% taurocho-\nlate added to quantify exclusively spore CFU. The resultant abundances were then con-\nverted to an overall spore-to-vegetative-cell ratio to suggest the fraction of the popula-\ntion undergoing sporulation. After overnight incubation, the group that received any\ncombination of N-acetylneuraminate or cytidine had signi ﬁcantly decreased levels of\nsporulation ratios relative to the no-additive control ( P values ,0.05) but no signi ﬁcant\nchange compared to the glucose-added control (Fig. 5B). Importantly, there were sig-\nniﬁcantly more vegetative cells under all additive conditions relative to BDM alone\n(Fig. S5; Pvalues,0.05). As was the case in the growth curve results, there was no dif-\nference between N-acetylneuraminate and cytidine when added alone versus their\ncombined effect. Collectively, these results support that both N-acetylneuraminate and\ncytidine utilization by C. dif ﬁcileinhibit progression through its life cycle toward spore\nformation. More broadly, our results support these GENREs as an advantageous discov-\nery platform for novel elements of C. dif ﬁcilemetabolism and physiology.\nDISCUSSION\nThe control for much of C. dif ﬁcile’s physiology and pathogenicity is subject to a co-\nalescence of metabolic signals from both inside and outside the cell. Historically, C. dif-\nﬁcileresearch has suffered from a shortage of molecular tools and high-quality predic-\ntive models for highlighting new potential therapies. Over the previous decade,GENREs have become powerful tools for connecting genotype with phenotype and\nprovided platforms for de ﬁning novel metabolic targets in biotechnology and improv-\ning interpretability of high-dimensional omics data.

Furthermore, as much of bacterial pathogenicity is\nnow being attributed to shifts in metabolism, the analyses described here may provide\nlarge bene ﬁts to the identi ﬁcation of possible treatment targets in C. dif ﬁcileand other\nrecalcitrant pathogens (88). In the current study, we develop and validate two highly\ncurated genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions for a well-described labora-\ntory strain (str. 630) in addition to a more recently characterized hypervirulent strain\n(str. R20291) of C. dif ﬁcile. Validation results from both models indicated signi ﬁcant\nagreement with both gene essentiality and carbon utilization screens, indicating ahigh degree of con ﬁdence in subsequent predictions for active metabolism.\nWe next employed a recently published technique for transcriptome contextualiza-\ntion with data sets from in vitro and in vivo systems to evaluate potential emergent\nmetabolic drivers of virulence. These combined analyses revealed differential reliance\non glycolysis-related metabolism during periods of increased virulence expression.Speci ﬁcally, in states of elevated bio ﬁlm formation by C. dif ﬁcilestr. R20291 we found\nthat glucose is necessary for nucleotide synthesis and redox balance through the pentose\nphosphate pathway, despite still being utilized for ATP under conditions associated with\nreduced bio ﬁlm. These ﬁndings were subsequently supported by direct testing in vitro and\nFIG 5 N-Acetylneuraminic acid and cytidine drive changes in str. 630 growth and sporulation.

Alternatively, during infection with str. 630 we\nidenti ﬁed patterns of host-derived glycan ( N-acetylneuraminate) utilization in combination\nwith consumption of the nucleotide precursor cytidine that corresponded with lower lev-\nels of sporulation. While not typically considered a carbon source for C. dif ﬁcile, laboratory\ntesting con ﬁrmed that C. dif ﬁcilecan indeed use cytidine for energy and, along with N-ace-\ntylneuraminate, decreases in sporulation. Intentional control of sporulation is an exciting\nprospect as spores are considered the transmissive form of C. dif ﬁcile,s ot h e s er e s u l t sm a y\nprove valuable for downstream targeted manipulation of C. dif ﬁcilevirulence factor expres-\nsion. Our results also supported a role for some level of amino acid fermentation across all\nconditions tested. This phenotype is a hallmark of C. dif ﬁcilephysiology and reinforced the\nvalidity of the other predictions. These results indicate a complex relationship with envi-ronmental nutrient concentrations and likely competition with the gut microbiota that all\ninform the regulation of C. dif ﬁcilevirulence expression. Additionally, in vivo context-spe-\nciﬁc gene essentiality also predicted proline racemase to be critical for growth during\ninfection, yet it was previously found to be dispensable in an animal model using a for-\nward genetic screen (90). This result may be attributable to the speci ﬁc conditions of that\ninfection and may vary across distinct host gut environments, leading to possible implica-\ntions in personalized medicine and novel approaches to curbing the expression of viru-\nlence factors by in ﬂuencing environmental conditions to favor certain forms of metabolism\nover others. This study represents the ﬁrst time that context-speci ﬁc models of bacterial\nmetabolism have been generated and used to augment discoveries for metabolic control\nover virulence expression in the laboratory.\nWhile the majority of predictions followed experimental results, several areas of\npossible expansion and curation are present in both GENREs. First, while the scope oftotal genes included in iCdG709 and iCdR703 may be more limited than previous net-\nwork reconstructions, we elected to focus on those gene sets where the greatest\namount of evidence and annotation data could be found to maximize con ﬁdence in\nfunctionality. Consequently, both GENREs consistently underpredict the impact of\nsome metabolite groups, primarily nucleotides and carboxylic acids, which could be\ndue to the absence of annotation or overall knowledge of the relevant cellular machin-\nery. Furthermore, more complex regulatory networks ultimately determine ﬁnal\nexpression of virulence factors, and these may be needed additions in the future to\ntruly understand the interplay of metabolism and pathogenicity in C. dif ﬁcile. Despite\nthese potential shortcomings, both iCdG709 and iCdR703 produced highly accurate\nmetabolic predictions for their respective strains as well as novel predictions for me-\ntabolism as it relates to C. dif ﬁcilevirulence expression, making both strong candidate\nplatforms for directing future studies of C. dif ﬁcile\nmetabolic pathways.\nSystems-biology approaches have enabled the assessment of ﬁne-scale changes to\nmetabolism of single species within complex environments that may have down-\nstream implications on health and disease. Overall, the combined in vitro - and in vivo -\nbased results demonstrated that our GENREs are effective platforms for gleaning addi-\ntional understanding from omics data sets, outside the standard analyses. Both\nGENREs were able to accurately predict complex metabolic phenotypes when provided\ncontext-speci ﬁc omics data and ultimately underscored the metabolic plasticity of C.\ndifﬁcile. The reciprocal utilization of glycolysis and amino acid fermentation indeed\nsupports regimes of distinct metabolic programming associated with C. dif ﬁcilepatho-\ngenicity. Finding core metabolic properties in C. dif ﬁcilestrains may be key in identify-\ning potential probiotic competitor strains or even molecular inhibitors of metabolic\ncomponents. The current study is an example of the strength that systems-level analy-\nses have in contributing to more rapid advancements in biological understanding. In\nthe future, the metabolic network reconstructions presented here will be well suited to\naccelerate research efforts toward the discovery of more targeted therapies. Overall,\nGENREs have had limited impact to date in real mechanistic understanding of infectious\ndisease, and the current study represents a signi ﬁcant advance in this application.Jenior et al.\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 14\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nC. dif ﬁcileGENRE construction. We utilized PATRIC reference genomes from Clostridioides dif ﬁcilestr.\n630 and Clostridioides dif ﬁcilestr.

The ModelSEED draft network reconstruction was converted utilizing the Mackinac pipe-\nline ( https://github.com/mmundy42/mackinac ) into a form more compatible with the COBRA toolbox (93 ).\nUpon removal of GENRE components lacking genetic evidence (i.e., gap- ﬁlled), extensive manual curation was\nperformed in accordance with best practices agreed upon by the community (94). We subsequently per-formed ensemble gap- ﬁlling as previously described, utilizing a stoichiometrically consistent anaerobic, Gram-\npositive universal reaction collection curated for this purpose and available alongside code associated with\nthis study. Next, we corrected reaction inconsistencies and incorrect physiological properties (e.g., ensuredfree water diffusion across compartments). Final transport reactions were then validated with TransportDB(95). All formulas are mass and charge balanced at an assumed pH of 7.0 using the ModelSEED database in\norder to maintain a consistent and supported namespace to augment GENRE interpretability and future cura-\ntion efforts. We then collected annotation data for all model components (genes, reactions, and metabolites)from SEED (94, 96), KEGG (97), PATRIC, RefSeq (98), EMBL (99), and BiGG (100) databases and integrated theminto the annotation ﬁeld dictionary now supported in the most recent SBML version (101).

All samples yielded over 22\nmillion total reads, with over 20 million mapped to the reference ( .93% of total reads, and .90% reads\nin pairs). Transcript reads for each gene were normalized to the total number of reads and gene length(expressed as reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads [RPKM]).Metabolic Determinants of C. dif ﬁcileVirulence\nSeptember/October 2021 Volume 6 Issue 5 e00919-21 msystems.asm.org 15\nDownloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/msystems on 17 May 2025 by 104.52.7.96.\n\nGenomic and transcriptomic data processing. Alignment of C. dif ﬁcilestr. 630 and str. R20291 pep-\ntide sequences was performed using bidirectional BLASTp. RNA-Seq reads were ﬁrst quality trimmed\nwith Sickle with a cutoff $Q30 (Joshi and Fass, 2011 [106]). Mapping curated reads to the respective C.\ndifﬁcilegenome was then performed with Bowtie2 (107). MarkDuplicates then removed optical and PCR\nduplicates (broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), and mappings were converted to idxstats format using\nSAMtools (108). Abundances were then normalized to both read and target lengths. Transcriptomic inte-\ngration and context-speci ﬁc model generation were performed with RIPTiDe (v3.2.3) using the max ﬁt_-\ncontextualize() function on the default settings (18).\nStatistical methods. All statistical analysis was performed in R v3.2.0. Nonmetric multidimensional\nscaling of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)analyses were accomplished using the vegan R package (109). Signi ﬁcant differences for single reaction\nﬂux distributions, metabolite concentrations, spore CFU, and growth over time were determined by\nWilcoxon signed-rank test. Supervised machine learning was accomplished with the implementation ofAUC-Random Forest also in R (110). Dissimilarity between C. dif ﬁcilestr. 630 growth curves was deter-\nmined using Dynamic Time Warping (111).\nData and code availability. Genomic and proteomic data for the strains Clostridioides dif ﬁcilestr.\n630 (PATRIC ref. 272563.8) and Clostridioides dif ﬁcilestr. R20291 (PATRIC ref. 645463.3) were downloaded\nfrom the PATRIC database (91). Transcriptomic data were downloaded in raw FASTQ format from the\nNCBI Sequence Read Archive ( PRJNA415307\nand PRJNA354635 ) and the Gene Expression Omnibus\n(GSE158225 ).

        ['Metabolic Drivers of Clostridioides difficile Virulence\n Uncovered\n \nSummary\nSummary Title:\nNovel Metabolic Drivers of Clostridioides difficile Virulence Identified via Metabolic Network Analysis\nBackground and Motivation:\nClostridioides difficile is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, primarily due to its\ntoxin-mediated diarrhea and increasing antibiotic resistance. Traditional antibiotic treatments can\ndisrupt gut microbiota, providing a niche for C. difficile colonization. The research focuses on targeting\nC. difficile\'s metabolism to combat infections as an alternative to antibiotics. Genome-scale metabolic\nnetwork reconstructions (GENREs) offer promising avenues for identifying metabolic processes linked\nto bacterial virulence.\nKey Findings/Contributions:\n\x7f GENREs were constructed and curated for both a hypervirulent strain (R20291) and a historic\nlaboratory strain (630) of C. difficile.\n\x7f These models were validated with in vitro and in vivo data, showing high predictive accuracy for\ncarbon source usage and gene essentiality.\n\x7f Specific metabolic pathways, such as the pentose phosphate pathway and others involved in\nsporulation and biofilm formation, were identified as drivers of virulence.\n\x7f Experimental results confirmed that specific metabolites reduced virulence expression by influencing\nmetabolic pathways.\nMethods/Approach:\n\x7f GENRE Construction: Developed for two bacterial strains, involving genome annotation, proteome\nalignment, and manual curation of known metabolic pathways.\n\x7f Validation: Validation against in vitro gene essentiality and carbon utilization data; correlation analysis\nwith experimental data showed high predictiveness.\n\x7f Context-specific Modeling: Integrated transcriptomic data for in vitro and infection conditions to tailor\nmetabolic models and identify key metabolic shifts associated with virulence.\nLimitations and Open Questions:\n\x7f While predictive, the models under-represent certain metabolite groups due to limited annotation.\n\x7f More complex regulatory networks need further exploration to fully understand metabolism-driven\nvirulence.\n\x7f The study opens avenues for assessing the metabolic interactions with gut microbiota, warranting\nfurther investigation into probiotic interventions.\nSignificance and Implications:\n\x7f This study enhances the understanding of how metabolic pathways regulate bacterial virulence,\noffering potential novel therapeutic targets that do not rely on conventional antibiotics.\n\x7f The findings have broader implications for treating antibiotic-resistant C. difficile strains by unveiling\nspecific metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted.\n\x7f GENREs serve as robust tools for metabolic research, facilitating the discovery of\nmetabolism-directed therapies in infectious diseases.\n\nClostridioides difficile is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, primarily due to its\ntoxin-mediated diarrhea and increasing antibiotic resistance. Traditional antibiotic treatments can\ndisrupt gut microbiota, providing a niche for C. difficile colonization. The research focuses on targeting\nC. difficile\'s metabolism to combat infections as an alternative to antibiotics. Genome-scale metabolic\nnetwork reconstructions (GENREs) offer promising avenues for identifying metabolic processes linked\nto bacterial virulence.\nGENRE Construction\nConstructing a genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE) for a bacterial pathogen like\nClostridioides difficile involves several key steps and tools. Here is an overview:\n1. Genome Annotation:\n\x7f Tools: Prodigal, RAST, or the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline.\n\x7f Annotate the genome to identify genes and predict their functions.\n2. Draft Model Construction:\n\x7f Tools: Pathway Tools, ModelSEED, or KBase.\n\x7f Use genome annotations to create an initial draft metabolic model by associating genes with\nmetabolic reactions.\n3. Metabolite and Reaction Identification:\n\x7f Identify and curate reactions and metabolites from databases such as KEGG, MetaCyc, and\nBRENDA.\n4. Gap-Filling:\n\x7f Tools: GapFind and GapFill algorithms.\n\x7f Address gaps in the network by adding reactions that allow the model to produce essential biomass\ncomponents.\n5. Model Refinement and Curation:\n\x7f Manually curate the model using literature and experimental data to correct errors and add missing\nreactions.\n\x7f Validate and refine the model using data from experimental studies to ensure physiological relevance.\n6. Network Validation and Simulation:\n\x7f Tools: COBRA Toolbox, OptFlux, or CellNetAnalyzer.\n\x7f Simulate growth conditions and compare predicted growth rates with experimental data.\n7. Integration with Omics Data:\n\x7f Incorporate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to refine and contextualize the model.\n8. Iterative Refinement:\n\x7f Continuous model validation and updates based on new experimental findings.\nKey Resources:\n\x7f Oberhardt, M. A., Palsson, B. Ø., & Papin, J. A. (2009). Applications of genome-scale metabolic\nreconstructions. Molecular Systems Biology, 5, 320.\n\x7f Thiele, I., & Palsson, B. Ø. (2010). A protocol for generating a high-quality genome-scale metabolic\nreconstruction. Nature Protocols, 5(1), 93-121.\nProteome Alignment\nProteome alignment plays a crucial role in the curation of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions\n(GENREs) by facilitating the accurate annotation of genes and their associated metabolic functions.\nThis process involves aligning protein sequences to genomic data to identify gene-protein-reaction\n(GPR) associations, which are essential for constructing comprehensive and functional metabolic\n\nmodels.\nOne notable tool in this domain is miniprot, a protein-to-genome aligner designed for mapping protein\nsequences to complete genomes. Miniprot integrates advanced techniques such as k-mer sketching\nand SIMD-based dynamic programming, offering significant speed improvements over existing tools\nwhile maintaining comparable accuracy. Its efficiency makes it particularly suitable for annotating genes\nin non-model organisms, thereby enhancing the quality of GENREs.\n([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08052?utm_source=openai))\nIn addition to miniprot, several other software tools and algorithms are commonly employed for\nproteome alignment during GENRE curation:\n\x7f CoReCo: This algorithm facilitates the automatic reconstruction of metabolic models for related\nspecies by leveraging protein homology alignments. It utilizes KEGG as a reaction database and\nincorporates automatic gap filling using atom maps of reactions, producing functional models ready for\nsimulation.\n([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolicnetworkmodelling?utm_source=openai))\n\x7f RAVEN Toolbox: RAVEN performs genome-wide functional annotations using template models or\nKEGG as sources for protein homology alignments. It is widely used for semi-automatic reconstruction\nof metabolic models, aiding in the identification of GPR associations. ([journals.scholarsportal.info](http\ns://journals.scholarsportal.info/html/22181989/v12i0001/nfpgmmeiuobd.xml?utmsource=openai))\n\x7f Pathway Tools: This bioinformatics software enables the reconstruction and prediction of metabolic\npathways, including reaction atom mappings and metabolic route searches. It contains MetaFlux gap\nfiller that automatically identifies missing reactions, nutrients, and secretions, thereby enhancing the\ncompleteness of metabolic models.\n([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolicnetworkmodelling?utm_source=openai))\nGene Essentiality Validation In Vitro\nTo validate gene essentiality in Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) in vitro, several standard assays\nand methods are employed:\n1. Transposon Mutagenesis and High-Throughput Sequencing (TraDIS):\n\x7f Method: A comprehensive transposon library is generated by inserting transposons randomly into the\nC. difficile genome. High-throughput sequencing identifies insertion sites.\n\x7f Interpretation: Genes lacking transposon insertions are considered essential, as disruptions in these\ngenes likely prevent bacterial survival under the tested conditions.\n([journals.asm.org](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mbio.02383-14?utm_source=openai))\n2. Targeted Gene Knockout with Complementation:\n\x7f Method: Specific genes are inactivated using techniques like the ClosTron system, which employs\ngroup II intron-mediated gene disruption. To confirm essentiality, a second functional copy of the gene\nis introduced elsewhere in the genome.\n\x7f Interpretation: If the bacterium remains viable only when the functional gene copy is present, the gene\nis deemed essential.\n([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5154367/?utm_source=openai))\n3. In Silico Metabolic Modeling:\n\x7f Method: Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are used to simulate metabolic\nfluxes. Computational analyses, such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), predict the impact of individual\ngene deletions on biomass production.\n\x7f Interpretation: Genes whose in silico deletion significantly reduces or halts biomass production are\npredicted to be essential. ([bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/arti\ncles/10.1186/s12918-014-0117-z?utm_source=openai))\n4. Flux Sampling with Graph Neural Networks (FluxGAT):\n\n\x7f Method: This approach integrates flux sampling data with graph neural networks to predict gene\nessentiality without relying on predefined cellular objective functions.\n\x7f Interpretation: Genes identified as essential through this unbiased computational method are\nconsidered critical for bacterial survival.\n([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18666?utm_source=openai))\nCarbon Source Utilization Assessment\nAssessing carbon source utilization in bacteria involves several techniques:\n1. Phenotype Microarrays (PMs): These high-throughput platforms evaluate bacterial growth on\nnumerous carbon sources simultaneously. Each well in a microplate contains a distinct carbon\nsubstrate, and bacterial growth is monitored, often using colorimetric indicators.\n2. Biolog Phenotype Microarrays: A specific type of PM, Biolog plates are widely used to assess\nmetabolic capabilities by measuring bacterial respiration in the presence of various carbon sources.\n3. Simmons\' Citrate Agar Test: This method determines a bacterium\'s ability to utilize citrate as its sole\ncarbon source. Growth and a color change in the medium indicate positive utilization.\n([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simmons%27citrateagar?utm_source=openai))\n4. Genome-Scale Metabolic Network Reconstructions (GENREs): These computational models predict\nmetabolic capabilities based on genomic data, allowing in silico analysis of carbon source utilization.\n([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8547418/?utm_source=openai))\nFor Clostridioides difficile, Biolog Phenotype Microarrays are predominantly used to assess carbon\nsource utilization. Studies have employed these microarrays to profile the growth of various C. difficile\nstrains on numerous carbon substrates, providing insights into their metabolic phenotypes.\n([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343193/?utm_source=openai))\nStatistical and Computational Validation of GENREs\nIn the validation of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs), several statistical and\ncomputational methods are employed to correlate model predictions with experimental data:\n1. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA): This constraint-based approach predicts steady-state flux distributions\nby optimizing an objective function, typically biomass production. FBA predictions are validated by\ncomparing in silico growth rates or growth/no-growth phenotypes across various substrates, growth\nconditions, or gene knockouts with experimental observations.\n([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10055486/?utm_source=openai))\n2. Flux Variability Analysis (FVA): FVA assesses the range of possible fluxes through each reaction\nunder given constraints, identifying reactions with low variability that may be critical to the organism.\nThis analysis helps in understanding the flexibility and robustness of metabolic networks.\n([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxbalanceanalysis?utm_source=openai))\n3. 13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C-MFA): By tracing the distribution of 13C-labeled substrates\nthrough metabolic pathways, 13C-MFA provides detailed insights into intracellular fluxes. These\nexperimentally determined fluxes are compared with model predictions to validate and refine GENREs.\n([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10055486/?utm_source=openai))\n4. Bayesian Metabolic Flux Analysis: This probabilistic approach models the entire metabolic system,\ninferring flux distributions based on experimental data and prior knowledge. It accounts for uncertainties\nand reveals flux couplings, offering a comprehensive validation framework.\n([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06673?utm_source=openai))\n5. Machine Learning Techniques: Advanced algorithms analyze discrepancies between model\npredictions and experimental data, identifying key metabolic fluxes and reaction pathways that\ninfluence model accuracy. For instance, machine learning has been used to highlight the importance of\n\nhydrogen ion exchange and central metabolism branch points in determining model accuracy.\n([embopress.org](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202311566?utm_source=openai))\n6. Statistical Metrics: Metrics such as the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) quantify the\naccuracy of model predictions. AUPRC is particularly useful in evaluating the correspondence between\npredicted and observed phenotypes, especially in high-throughput mutant fitness data.\n([embopress.org](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202311566?utm_source=openai))\nContext-Specific Metabolic Modeling\nContext-specific metabolic modeling involves integrating transcriptomic data into genome-scale\nmetabolic reconstructions (GENREs) to tailor the models to specific conditions or tissues. This\nintegration helps refine the metabolic network by emphasizing reactions that are more likely active\nunder given conditions, based on gene expression levels.\nKey Algorithms Used\n1. GIMME (Gene Inactivity Moderated by Metabolism and Expression):\nThis method incorporates transcriptomic data to minimize the discrepancies between gene expression\ndata and the predicted metabolic activity. It selects a subset of reactions that fulfills a specific objective\nwhile ensuring that reactions associated with highly expressed genes are active.\nReference: Becker, S. A., & Palsson, B. O. (2008). "Context-Specific Metabolic Networks Are\nConsistent with Experiments," PLOS Computational Biology.\n2. iMAT (Integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool):\niMAT uses gene expression data to categorize reactions into three groups: highly expressed,\nmoderately expressed, and not expressed. The algorithm then finds an optimal configuration that\nmaximizes the consistency between the model and high expression levels.\nReference: Zur, H., & Ruppin, E. (2007). "iMAT: An Integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool," Molecular\nSystems Biology.\n3. INIT (Integrative Network Inference for Tissues):\nThis method uses a scoring system based on transcriptomic data to prioritize reactions, creating a\ntissue-specific model. It emphasizes the importance of tissue-specific reactions by integrating\nexpression data with the metabolic model.\nReference: Jensen, P. A., Lutz, K. A., & Papin, J. A. (2011).
