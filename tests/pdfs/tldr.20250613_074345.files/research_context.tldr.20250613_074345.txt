### Summary of Experimental Results & Findings on C. difficile

**Experimental Results:**
- Laboratory results were collected for both strains of *Clostridioides difficile*.
- The application of 100 mM glycine significantly reduced the percentage of spores from a highly virulent strain.

**Key Findings:**
- Exclusion mechanisms are not primarily related to nutrient limitations in the vegetative form but rather the depletion of the co-germinant glycine.
- This research marks the first identification of a possible mechanism for preventing recurrent *C. difficile* infections via precolonization, as demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial.

**Metabolic Insights:**
- Analyzed metabolic pathways in a murine model revealed a reliance on the pentose phosphate pathway during *C. difficile* pathophysiology, especially from initial colonization.
- Context-specific metabolic network analysis highlighted how certain strains can outcompete established *C. difficile* strains.

**Importance of Antibiotic Impact:**
- It is crucial to explore metabolic changes during infection, as these insights can lead to novel therapies.
- Previous studies have shown differing impacts of antibiotic classes on gut microbiota, while similarly affecting susceptibility to *C. difficile* colonization.
